An R package implementing online methods for computing sufficient
statistics of networks.

Online a few "local" statistics are implemented. Note that a small
subset of network statistics are really feasible to do in an online
fashion.  For example, betweenness would be impossible.

Draws heavily on code buried within the ergm package from the statnet
suite of statistical network packages.
