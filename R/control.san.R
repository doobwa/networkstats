# The <control.san> function creates a list of paramaters
# for customizing the <ergm.san> routines
#
# --PARAMETERS--
#   prop.weights  : specifies the method used to allocate probabilities
#                  of being proposed to dyads; options are "TNT",
#                   "random", "nonobserved" and "default"; default=
#                   NULL if X is an ergm (which then uses the weights
#                   that the ergm was fit by); default="default" if
#                   X is a formula (which picks a reasonable default
#                   considering any constraints)
#   maxedges      : the maximum number of edges expected in network
#   network.output: the R class with which to output networks; the
#                   options are "network" and "edgelist.compressed"
#                   (which saves space but only supports networks
#                    without vertex attributes); default="network"
#
# --IGNORED--
#   prop.args     : an alternative, direct way of specifying additional
#                   arguments to proposal; as far as I can tell, the
#                   only use for 'prop.args' is to supply the name
#                   of a nodal attribute for use in the
#                   <InitMHP.nobetweengroupties> function, but this
#                   function will never be called in the path from
#                   <ergm.san> which is the only code using this
#                   control list.
#   drop          : whether degenerate terms should be dropped from the
#                   fit (T or F); default=TRUE;  this was used in
#                   <ergm.san>, but is now commented out
#   packagenames  : the names of packages in which changestatistics
#                   are found; currently ignored as ‘ergm’ is presumed;
#                   default="ergm"
#   maxchanges    : ??; default=1000000
#   parallel      : number of threads in which to run the sampling; 
#                   currently unimplemented in <ergm.san> or the
#                   subsequent call to <ergm.mple>
#
# --RETURNED--
#   a list of the above parameters
