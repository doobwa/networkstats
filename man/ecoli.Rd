\title{Two versions of an E. Coli network dataset}
\alias{ecoli}
\alias{ecoli1}
\alias{ecoli2}
\description{
This network data set comprises two versions of a biological
network in which the nodes are operons in \emph{Escherichia Coli}
and a directed edge from one node to another indicates that 
the first encodes the transcription factor that regulates the second.
}

\usage{data(ecoli)}

\details{
The network object \code{ecoli1} is directed, with 423 nodes and 519 arcs.
The object \code{ecoli2} is an undirected version of the same network, in 
which all arcs are treated as edges and the five isolated nodes (which exhibit
only self-regulation in \code{ecoli1}) are removed, leaving 418 nodes.
}

\source{
The data set is based on the RegulonDB network (Salgado et al, 2001)
and was modified by Shen-Orr et al (2002).
