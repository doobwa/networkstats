\title{Plot Goodness-of-Fit Diagnostics on a Exponential Family Random Graph Model}
\description{
  \code{\link{plot.gofobject}} plots diagnostics such as the 
  degree distribution, geodesic distances, shared partner distributions,
  and reachability for the goodness-of-fit of exponential family random graph
  models.  See \code{\link{ergm}} for more information on these models.
}
\usage{
\method{plot}{gofobject}(x, \dots,
         cex.axis=0.7, plotlogodds=FALSE,
         main = "Goodness-of-fit diagnostics",
         normalize.reachability=FALSE,
         verbose=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{an object of class \code{gofobject}, 
       typically produced by the
       \code{\link{gof.ergm}} or \code{\link{gof.formula}} functions.
       See the documentation for these.}
  \item{cex.axis}{Character expansion of the axis labels relative to that for
   the plot.}
  \item{plotlogodds}{Plot the odds of a dyad having given
  characteristics (e.g., reachability, minimum geodesic
  distance, shared partners). This is an alternative to the
  probability of a dyad having the same property.}
  \item{main}{Title for the goodness-of-fit plots.}
  \item{normalize.reachability}{Should the reachability proportion be 
   normalized to make it more comparable with the other geodesic distance 
   proportions.}
  \item{verbose}{Provide verbose information on the progress of the
    plotting.}
  \item{\dots}{Additional arguments, to be passed to the plot function.}
}

\details{
  \code{\link{gof.ergm}} produces a sample of networks randomly drawn from the specified model.
  This function produces a plot of the summary measures.
