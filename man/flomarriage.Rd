\title{Florentine Family Marriage Ties Data as a ``network" object}
\alias{flomarriage}
\description{
This is a data set of marriage ties among
Renaissance Florentine families. The data is originally from
Padgett (1994) via \code{UCINET} and stored as a \code{\link[network]{network}} object.

Breiger \& Pattison (1986), in their discussion of local
role analysis, use a subset of data on the social relations
among Renaissance Florentine families (person aggregates)
collected by John Padgett from historical documents. The 
relations are marriage alliances (\code{\link{flomarriage}} betwween the families.

As Breiger \& Pattison point out, the original data are
symmetrically coded. This is perhaps acceptable perhaps for marital ties.
Vertex information is provided on (1) \code{wealth} each family's net wealth in 1427
(in thousands of lira); (2) \code{priorates} the number of priorates (seats on
the civic council) held between 1282- 1344; and (3) \code{totalties} the total
number of business or marriage ties in the total dataset of
116 families (see Breiger \& Pattison (1986), p 239).

Substantively, the data include families who were locked
in a struggle for political control of the city of Florence
around 1430. Two factions were dominant in this struggle:
one revolved around the infamous Medicis (9), the other around
the powerful Strozzis (15).
